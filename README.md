Neos Bootstrap Package
=========================================================

With this package you can create rapid content prototypes based on twitter bootstrap

## The grid
The bootstrap grid is a very popular html based grid framework. Neos CMS provides some elements for structuring content out of the box. This package does some modifications to provide better twitter bootstrap grid support.
 
### Modified NodeTypes
```
Neos.NodeTypes:TwoColumn
Neos.NodeTypes:ThreeColumn
Neos.NodeTypes:FourColumn
```

### New NodeTypes
```
Webandco.Bootstrap:OneColumn // Structuring one column content
```

## Roadmap
* New Neos UI support
* Better grid definition support. Select box instead of string input
* Responsive grid definition support.
